The media already blew their entire load whipping the country into a fever pitch over separation, so it's going to be exceedingly difficult to get people back to such a crescendo with Trump being able to simply say, "Families are united and I'm the one who fixed it." <!--1009693561019760640-->

Families will now be jailed together, families that have already been separated won't be re-united, asylum cases will be denied even more expeditiously, UAC-to-DACA pipeline will be closed, and moreover, both immigration bills are on the verge of failure. <!--1009693559769858048-->

By evening, a grim reality began to set in. <!--1009693557689421824-->

It also means an end to the UAC-to-DACA/amnesty pipeline. <!--1009693556485701632-->

This is to avoid judicial scrutiny (not that they won't try anyway) while Sessions attempts to modify the agreement so that detention is indefinite. <!--1009693554212388864-->

Adults went to jail, children to detention centers or shelters. <!--1009693546046111744-->

TL;DR summary: Only good for 20 days, doesn't override Flores (so somewhat impervious to being struck down), adults and children detained together, Sessions working to expand indefinitely, no more expanded DACA incentive. <!--1009693544963977216-->
